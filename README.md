# Digit_classificationn
I have designed a project using mnist dataset to identify digit classification of digits 0-9 using support vector machine algorithm.The final accuracy i have got using this model is approximately 92%.Non linear model gave more accuracy than linear model so i have concluded problem is highly non-linear in nature
